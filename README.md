# My C# Portfolio

Hey! I'm Neomar, a 15-year-old programmer from Venezuela.
Everything here was built on my phone. Yes, a phone.

**My motto:** Never give up. Problems exist? Cool, let's solve them.

## What I Know
- 🔵 **C#** (this is my thing)
- 🟣 **.NET** (console apps)
- 🟢 **Visual Studio** / VS Code
- 🎮 **Unity** & **Godot** (making basic games)

## My Projects

### 🧮 Calculator with History
It adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, does powers, square roots...
And it REMEMBERS everything (yes, it saves to a file). Also has stats.

### 🎮 Text Adventure Game
You make choices, the story changes. Like those old games but made by me.

### 🔢 Auto Counter
Numbers. Counting. Simple but useful.

## Why Me?
I don't fake my resume. I just really, really like programming.
Most of my free time? Studying C#. Nothing to do? I write code.

Ask me anything about C#. If I know it, I'll tell you. If I don't, I'll be honest.

Hit me up if you want to talk code or opportunities.
